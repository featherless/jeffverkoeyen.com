What is arm64_32? It's a 64 bit operating system that runs on 32 bit pointers.

When you test on the watchOS simulator, you're typically going to be testing with 64-bit pointers,
so you'll get a 64 bit Int when testing in sim and a 32 bit Int when testing on hardware.

Something as simple as

```swift
print(String(Int(Date.now.timeIntervalSince1970 * 1000)))
```

can work fine in the simulator but causes a runtime crash on hardware. Be mindful of your use of Int
and CGFloat types when deploying code to the Apple Watch.

Here's the output of Int.max on each platform:

| Simulator |  Hardware (oh no!)  |
